                <h5>On Page SEO</h5>
                <p>
                    Before briefing you about on-page SEO optimization, here is a short introduction to what an On-Page
                    SEO is.
                </p>
                <p>It is the optimization of each of the web pages on your website. Optimization involves a lot of
                    factors including but not limited to optimizing titles, meta description, page content, adding
                    internal and external links, etc. This optimization is done to increase the chances of popping up on
                    searches. The crawler identifies these optimizations and chooses the best-optimized web pages first.
                </p>

                <br /><br />
                <p>On the page, optimization keeps evolving over the years. There are more and more methods of
                    optimization than ever before. Here are some of the current, up to date optimizations.
                </p>
                <p><b>Content</b></p>
                <p>The reader will only stay on the page if the content is worth reading. So the most important factor
                    which decides on-page SEO is quality content for the user.
                </p>
                <p>Content quality has already been explained in my previous post, but here is a short explanation.
                </p>
                <p>Original content (Without copying other webpages, rewrites) with good use of keywords, which is not
                    biased in any manner. The content must be well researched, not for the sake of publishing articles.
                    The content must not be too short. It must not deviate from the title.
                </p>
                <p>Speaking of Title, optimization of Title, and Meta description is also another important on-page SEO
                    optimization technique.
                </p>
                <p>Spend more time on your titles and meta description because the keywords you enter in the title is
                    the one which the user reads first to see if it is relevant to his search or not. The search engine
                    crawler also does the same, it ranks the pages according to the title optimization (including other
                    optimizations like technical SEO, Off-page SEO).
                </p>
                <p>The meta description is the paragraph below the title which describes the page you are about to
                    click. The meta description should not be more than 150 words or less than 50 words. This is the
                    length that the search engine defines as optimal. More words than this and your website will not
                    show up on top when crawling.
                </p>

                <br /><br />

                <p><b>H1 Tag </b></p>
               <p>The < H1> HTML tag (Hypertext Markup Language) is the heading of the page. It is the first thing you see when you enter the page.
               </p>
               <p>The HTML tag has six tags namely h1, h2 so on till h6 each being less important than the other respectively.
            </p>
            <p>The H1 tag is the main title which is displayed as the link to your page. So it should be well thought out to get the user to click on your link.
            </p>
            <p>H1 tag is one of the most important factors in On-Page SEO because it is a notable ranking factor in google’s search algorithm due to its being the most prominent content on the page which is usually noticed first by the user.
            </p>
            <p><b>Here are some tips to optimize the use of H1 tag</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use only one H1 tag
<p>The use of one H1 tag denotes the crawler that the article is only about one keyword and one topic. It will not confuse the crawler and can also make your pages rank higher than pages with two or more h1 tags</p>
                </li>  
                <li>Length of the H1 tag
                <p>The H1 tag must be between 20-80 characters in length. If it is too long, it ranks lower and if it is too short, there is not much information on the title and the user may be disinterested. 
                </p>    
                </li>
                <li>Keywords
               <p>The use of keywords in an H1 tag seems like the obvious thing to do. It is the best strategy but too much of something is always bitter.
            </p>
            <p> Do not stuff the title with lots of keywords. Use only one keyword so google’s crawlers can better understand when your page is needed and get a better ranking.
            </p>
                </li>
                <li>Use Tools
                    <p>There are SEO tools for almost every aspect of optimization. Use h1 audit tools like ‘screaming frog’ and type in your URL. 
                        Then click the h1 tag and see suggested h1 tags that are missing and can be used for better optimization.
                        </p>
                        <p>In conclusion, we have seen the basic on-page SEO optimizations and some more advanced but important methods. With this, you are sure to rank higher than ever before on search engine algorithms.
